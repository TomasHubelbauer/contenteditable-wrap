# Content Editable Caret

I'm trying to figure out how to have a content editable element and surround and
unsurround ranges in it while preserving the selection.

## Testing

Open the page and append a space and then a letter at the end of the editor.

## To-Do

## Figure out the clearing process

Figure out the clearing process which flattens the HTML structure so it always
starts from a single text node.

## Consider working with the existing nested structure

This would be too complex to keep track of all the things, especially since
there are alternatives which are less complex, but it's worth pondering.
